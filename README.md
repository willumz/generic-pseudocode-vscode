<!-- [![Visual Studio Marketplace Downloads](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/d/willumz.generic-pseudocode)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=willumz.generic-pseudocode) -->

A simple extension for syntax highlighting of generic pseudocode. (file extension: `.pseudo`)

Syntax highlighting exists for multiple variants of common pseudocode keywords, allowing you to use your own style and not confining you to a specific format.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

The following items have syntax highlighting. Synonyms are separated by spaces.

#### Keywords:
```
output print e.g. output "Hello World"
input
if
else
try
catch except
import
while loop
for
foreach
return
set e.g. set x = 1
switch
case
break
continue
do
end
```
#### Operators:
```
and &&
or ||
not !
in
```
#### Functions:
```
function
procedure
e.g.
    function say(x) do
        print x
    end
    say("Hello World")
```
#### Classes:
```
class
extends
e.g.
    class A do
        constructor() do
            print "Hi"
        end
    end
e.g.
    class B extends A do
        constructor() do
            print "Hi"
        end
    end
```
#### Structs:
```
struct
e.g.
    struct A do
        
    end
```
#### Template Strings:
```
${}
e.g.
    set user = "John"
    print "Hello, ${user}!"
```

### Snippets
![Snippets](images/snippets.gif)

Note: all snippets have uppercase variants beginning with 'u'

### Customisable Keywords
You can also define your own custom keywords in a config file.

If you aren't content with the predefined keywords included, you can now add your own to a `.pseudoconfig` file located in your user's home directory (`~/.pseudoconfig` or `C:\Users\{username}\.pseudoconfig`).

**To use this feature you must make sure** `editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled` **is set to** `true` **in VSCode.**

The config file should contain a JSON object, with a single key `"custom"` containing an object with a single key `"keyword"` (the only scope currently supported for custom highlighting) which has a value of an array of strings, which holds your custom keywords.

Example:
```json
{
    "custom": {
        "keyword": [
            "customKeyword",
            "exampleWord"
        ]
    }
}
```
In the above example, both `customKeyword` and `exampleWord` will be highlighted as keywords.

NOTE: You must reload the extension after editing the config file.

NOTE: Local config files in the active directory are not currently supported. You can currently only use a global config file which is placed in the home directory.
